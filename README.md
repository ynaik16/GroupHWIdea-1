Group homework to understand CRM

Project done in Android Studio. It is a basic contact manager application where you can
add contacts that are placed in a ListView. There are comments for almost every line to understand
the meaning for the code.


* Clone and try for yourself. Need an android device or install a emulator through Android Studio: https://developer.android.com/studio

* Things to work on:
    * Actually saving the user info
    * Better UI (text should scale inside the ListView element)
    * Features!! (Who are my customers?)
    * More TBA
